I worked as a Fullstack Developer with a strong focus on frontend development in the Integral Services division, where we implemented innovative solutions for the banking industry across the United States and Latin America. Our team developed both web and mobile applications for enterprise and retail clients, adapting solutions to the unique demands of each market.

In this role, I utilized technologies like Outsystems for rapid application development, Java to ensure backend robustness, and React to build interactive, scalable interfaces. This position allowed me to deepen my expertise in delivering robust fintech solutions and creating optimized user experiences for various devices. The diversity and scope of the projects provided me with a broad perspective on the technological needs of the financial sector at an international level.
