I served as a Fullstack Developer in the Mortgage division, focusing on maintaining and upgrading systems for a U.S.-based client base. 
My role involved not only performing maintenance and technology migrations but also developing an MVP for a new mortgage platform, where I contributed to the full lifecycle of the project.

The tech stack primarily included Java, C#, React, and Angular, which I leveraged to build scalable and reliable solutions. This position allowed me to refine my expertise in both frontend and backend technologies, contributing to the delivery of high-quality solutions tailored to the financial services industry. My work in this role helped streamline and modernize mortgage-related systems, driving efficiency and creating a foundation for future innovation within the division.
